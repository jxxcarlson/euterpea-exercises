# Euterpea: Notes, Exercises, and Compositions 

*There is a lot of clean-up to do in this repo*

## Homework

Notes and homework solutions *The Haskell School of Music* by Paul Hudak
and Donya Quick.  Current status is:

- `./src`: I'm working Chapter 3
- `./completed`: Chapter 2

## Compositions

1. Chorale.hs
2. NervousChase.hs: based on L-systems, as in HSOM, ch. 13
3. SpaceInvation.hs: I took [Donya Quick's code](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2-Examples/blob/master/NoteLevel/RandomMusic.lhs) as a starting point.  Uses Random walk.
